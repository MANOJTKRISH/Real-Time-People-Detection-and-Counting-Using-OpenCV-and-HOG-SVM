# Real-Time-People-Detection-and-Counting-Using-OpenCV-and-HOG-SVM
This project detects and counts people in real-time using OpenCV with a laptop's webcam. It utilizes the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) + SVM model to detect individuals and displays the count on the screen. Detected people are highlighted with red boxes. Ideal for crowd monitoring, surveillance, and smart environments.
